# vite-plugin-tsc-build

A Vite plugin that uses the TypeScript compiler instead of esbuild to build your TypeScript project. This plugin is especially useful when your project uses specific TypeScript features that are not fully supported by esbuild, such as:

- Support for isolatedModules = false
- Implicit type-only imports
- Cross-module const enum inlining

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-tsc-build
```

## Usage

Add the plugin to your vite.config.js or vite.config.ts:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tscBuildPlugin from "vite-plugin-tsc-build";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
  plugins: [
    tscBuildPlugin({
      enabled: mode === "production",
      // tsc: ["-b"]  // Optionally, override tsc command line arguments
    }),
  ];
});
```

## How it works

When the plugin is enabled, it runs the TypeScript compiler (tsc -b) during the buildStart phase of the Vite build process. The plugin then replaces the contents of the imported .ts or .tsx files with the compiled output files generated by tsc.

## Limitations

Keep in mind that this plugin only works in build mode, as it is designed to address the limitations of esbuild when building TypeScript projects. In development mode, you should continue to use esbuild for faster development experience.
